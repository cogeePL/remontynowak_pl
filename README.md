Just a simple web for a small bussines. 
Made with HTML, CSS and some JS (just a bit). 
If You get in to code, pay no attention to the inconsistency of BEM application in CSS ;) I had to recover some of the code which I lost :( and recovery didn' went so smooth as I could wish to myself... though web works just fine, so why should I touch it?
